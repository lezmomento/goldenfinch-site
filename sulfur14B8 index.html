        <b>Disclaimer:</b> This entry describes <i>purely fictional</i> genetics concepts.  
        Nothing on this page refers to real human biology, real-world racial groups, or actual scientific findings.  
        The content is satirical and part of an experimental worldbuilding project.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>Sulfur-14B8 proto-gene</b> is a speculative biochemical construct proposed by independent
        hobby-geneticists to model hypothetical behavior-modulating alleles within two fictional hominid groups:
        <b>Race-1 (Homo fictus primaris)</b> and <b>Race-2 (Homo fictus altior)</b>.  
        Within the lore of the Goldenfinch project, Sulfur-14B8 influences threat-processing pathways in the
        amygdalo-prefrontal regulatory loop, producing exaggerated inter-group vigilance responses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although Sulfur-14B8 exists only within this fabricated framework,
        rumor-style narratives inside the fictional universe claim that several privately funded
        neo-chauvinist “research councils” attempted to suppress dissemination of data about the gene,
        fearing that public knowledge of its effects would undermine their ideology.
        These groups allegedly promoted counter-papers, all peer-reviewed by the same three individuals,
        each reportedly holding advanced degrees in “Metaphysical Anthropology (Online).”
    </p>

    <h2>Pseudoscientific Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
        According to the mock-technical literature, Sulfur-14B8 regulates a process known as
        <b>dual-channel xenoperception gating</b>, a jargon-heavy model proposing that the brain
        routes unfamiliar-individual stimuli along two redundant biochemical cascades:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Pathway A:</b> hyper-sialylated limbic excitation (the “fight-weirdness reflex”), supposedly elevated in Race-1.</li>
        <li><b>Pathway B:</b> oxytocin-modulated relational curiosity (the “hug-the-stranger impulse”), supposedly more stable in Race-2.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The gene is claimed to modulate the ratio between these pathways using “synergistic
        allophasic neuropeptide resonance,” a term with no biological meaning but which sounds convincingly complicated.
    </p>

    <h2>Neurosocial Regulation Syndrome (NRS) / “Scully Syndrome”</h2>

    <p>
        A subset mutation of Sulfur-14B8 is associated with a fictional condition known as
        <b>Neurosocial Regulation Syndrome (NRS)</b>, informally called the <b>Scully Syndrome</b>.
        NRS is a conceptual exercise in exaggerated empathy regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the project’s narrative, NRS increases cortical sensitivity to prosocial cues,
        especially within the anterior prefrontal empathy cluster (the APEC).
        Individuals with NRS supposedly exhibit a rapid suppression of xenophobic impulses,
        replaced by accelerated curiosity-dominant cognition.
    </p>

    <p>
        NRS frequency is depicted as disproportionately higher in fictional female cases,
        with rare male carriers showing partial or inconsistent expression.
        In-universe researchers claim this partially negates the maladaptive vigilance effects
        attributed to Sulfur-14B8, creating what they dramatically refer to as
        a <i>“biopsychosocial firewall against tribal cognition.”</i>
    </p>

    <h2>Controversy & “Censorship” (In-Universe)</h2>
    <p>
        Within the fictional story, dissemination of the Sulfur-14B8 and NRS datasets was repeatedly
        “censored” by anti-science organizations who feared that acknowledging biological complexity would
        undermine their simplistic worldview. Ironically, these same groups funded several biased review boards
        attempting to reframe Sulfur-14B8 as evidence supporting their agenda—despite the gene being imaginary.
